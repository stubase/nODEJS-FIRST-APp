# Capstone Project HiBykes App

## Overview

HiBykes is an android application that implements a machine learning model to predict bike sharing demand. The idea for this project comes up from a sense of concern for various urban mobility problems in Indonesia. We know that air pollution and traffic congestion is a common phenomenon in every big city, including in Jakarta. This situation is getting worse every year since the annual vehicle growth rate is very high, leading to many negative effects. Now, changes are needed by using eco-friendly vehicles such as bikes. The rapid growth of the sharing economy makes bike-sharing will be in high demand. However, a limited number of bikes can cause people who are interested in using bike-sharing may not even get a bike and bring up the waiting time when the bike station runs out of bikes. To tackle those problems, HiBykes is present as a potential solution that makes it easier for users to check the predicted results of bike-sharing demand levels at each station just from their smartphone.
